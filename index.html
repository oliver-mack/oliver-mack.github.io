                    <h1>Hi! I'm Oliver Mack</h1>
                    <p>When I was the editor of my high school newspaper, the schoolâ€™s administration cancelled a controversial speaker, leading to outrage within the student body and a faculty sit-in. The school tried to censor our paper and other local journalists from telling the deeper story of the cancellation, and it lit a journalistic fire within me. I am now a determined and passionate journalist focused on creating change in my community through holding leaders accountable and fostering an environment of truth. My work ethic and compassion drive me to always do my best and to continue learning with each step I take. I am now a journalism and government and politics double major at The University of Maryland and I hope to fully immerse myself in learning and growing as a journalist while here.</p>
